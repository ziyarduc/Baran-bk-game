# Lighting & Lumen

UE5's default lighting pipeline is **fully dynamic**: Lumen provides global illumination
(GI) and reflections without a bake. Understanding the light component hierarchy,
mobility rules, and the Lumen/post-process stack lets you get correct and performant
results quickly.

## When to use this skill

- Creating or modifying a light component in C++ (type selection, intensity/color/units,
  attenuation, IES profiles, light functions).
- Choosing the right mobility for a light and understanding the GI/shadow consequences.
- Enabling, tuning, or debugging Lumen GI and Lumen Reflections.
- Setting up sky atmosphere, sky light, volumetric clouds, and exponential height fog.
- Configuring post process volumes for exposure, auto-exposure, bloom, color grading,
  or per-area Lumen overrides.
- Placing reflection captures for areas Lumen cannot reach (legacy or spec-heavy interiors).
- Deciding when to use baked Lightmass vs Lumen.

## Light component hierarchy

All light components derive from `USceneComponent` through the following chain:

```
USceneComponent
└─ ULightComponentBase        (LightComponentBase.h:15) — Intensity, LightColor, CastShadows
   ├─ ULightComponent         (LightComponent.h:48)     — Temperature, ShadowBias, IES, LightFunction
   │  ├─ ULocalLightComponent (LocalLightComponent.h:18) — AttenuationRadius, IntensityUnits
   │  │  ├─ UPointLightComponent (PointLightComponent.h:19) — SourceRadius, SourceLength
   │  │  │  └─ USpotLightComponent (SpotLightComponent.h:17) — InnerConeAngle, OuterConeAngle
   │  │  └─ URectLightComponent  (RectLightComponent.h:24) — SourceWidth, SourceHeight, BarnDoorAngle
   │  └─ UDirectionalLightComponent (DirectionalLightComponent.h:18) — DynamicShadowCascades, bAtmosphereSunLight
   └─ USkyLightComponent      (SkyLightComponent.h:101)  — bRealTimeCapture, SourceType, Cubemap
```

See [references/light-components-and-mobility.md](references/light-components-and-mobility.md)
for C++ patterns and per-type properties.

## Light types at a glance

| Component | Shape | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `UDirectionalLightComponent` | infinite parallel rays | sun, moon, any directional source |
| `UPointLightComponent` | sphere/capsule omnidirectional | light bulbs, candles, explosions |
| `USpotLightComponent` : Point | cone | torches, headlights, stage spots |
| `URectLightComponent` | planar rectangle | TVs, windows, fluorescent strips |
| `USkyLightComponent` | cubemap capture | ambient IBL, sky bounce |

## Mobility and its lighting consequences

Mobility is set on the component via `SetMobility(EComponentMobility::Movable)`.

| Mobility | Direct light | Indirect light | Shadows | Runtime change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Static** | baked into lightmaps | baked | baked | none |
| **Stationary** | dynamic direct, baked indirect | baked (Lightmass) | mixed (baked static, dynamic movable) | color/intensity only |
| **Movable** | fully dynamic | Lumen GI (no bake) | Virtual Shadow Maps | all properties |

Key rule for Lumen: **only Movable lights feed Lumen GI**. Static lights are entirely
stored in lightmaps and their contribution is disabled when Lumen is enabled.
Stationary lights contribute baked indirect; their direct pass is dynamic.

Stationary limit: a single primitive can overlap at most **four** Stationary lights
before the fifth reverts to fully dynamic (expensive). The editor shows this with a red
channel-limit indicator.

## Lumen (dynamic GI + reflections)

Lumen is the default GI system for new UE5 projects. It computes diffuse interreflection
and specular reflections in real time, across scales from millimeters to kilometers.

**Enabling:** Project Settings → Rendering → Dynamic Global Illumination: **Lumen**;
Reflection Method: **Lumen**. Enabling Lumen automatically enables Generate Mesh
Distance Fields (required for software ray tracing) and disables precomputed lightmaps.

**Two tracing modes:**
- **Software Ray Tracing** — traces against Signed Distance Fields; works on all
  DX11+ hardware; requires `Generate Mesh Distance Fields` in project settings.
- **Hardware Ray Tracing (HRT)** — uses the GPU BVH; higher quality reflections and
  hit-lighting; enabled in Project Settings → Rendering → Hardware Ray Tracing.

Quality is tuned per-camera in a `APostProcessVolume` via `FPostProcessSettings`
fields (all in `Engine/Classes/Engine/Scene.h`):

| `FPostProcessSettings` field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LumenSceneLightingQuality` (line 1783) | fidelity of the Lumen scene cache |
| `LumenFinalGatherQuality` (line 1799) | noise vs cost of the final gather pass |
| `LumenMaxTraceDistance` (line 1811) | max ray length; too small leaks GI into caves |
| `LumenReflectionQuality` (line 1846) | reflection ray quality |

See [references/lumen-gi-and-reflections.md](references/lumen-gi-and-reflections.md)
for the full Lumen settings table, emissive GI, and hardware ray tracing notes.

## Virtual Shadow Maps (VSMs)

VSMs are the default shadow technology for Movable and Stationary lights when Lumen
is active. They render into a virtualized (sparse) 16k×16k shadow atlas, support
Nanite geometry natively, and require no per-light manual distance tuning.

Enable via Project Settings → Rendering → Shadows → Shadow Map Method: **Virtual
Shadow Maps**. The CVars `r.Shadow.Virtual.*` control quality and cache behaviour.

Key shadow properties on `ULightComponent` (`LightComponent.h`):
- `ShadowBias` (line 113) / `ShadowSlopeBias` (line 123) — self-shadow acne
- `ContactShadowLength` (line 131) — screen-space contact shadow ray length
- `CastShadows` / `CastDynamicShadows` / `CastStaticShadows` — per-channel toggle

For `UDirectionalLightComponent`, cascaded shadow maps are set with
`DynamicShadowCascades` (line 73) and `DynamicShadowDistanceMovableLight` (line 59).

See [references/shadows-and-postprocess.md](references/shadows-and-postprocess.md).

## Sky, atmosphere, and fog

A complete outdoor sky in C++ uses three cooperating actors/components:

1. `UDirectionalLightComponent` with `bAtmosphereSunLight = true` — drives the sky color.
2. `USkyAtmosphereComponent` (`Components/SkyAtmosphereComponent.h`) — physically-based
   atmosphere scattering.
3. `USkyLightComponent` with `bRealTimeCapture = true` — recaptures the rendered sky
   every tick for ambient/IBL.

Fog depth and god rays come from `UExponentialHeightFogComponent`
(`Components/ExponentialHeightFogComponent.h`). Enable volumetric fog on it for
`VolumetricFogScatteringDistribution` and `VolumetricFogAlbedo` to feed Lumen GI.

## Post Process Volume and exposure

`APostProcessVolume` (`Engine/PostProcessVolume.h`) hosts `FPostProcessSettings`
(`Engine/Scene.h:711`). Set `bUnbound = true` for a global volume; bounded volumes
blend by distance (Priority and BlendRadius fields).

Exposure settings in `FPostProcessSettings`:
- `AutoExposureMethod` (line 1491) — `AEM_Histogram` (default) or `AEM_Basic`
- `AutoExposureBias` (line 1933) — EV100 offset for all metering modes
- `AutoExposureMinBrightness` / `AutoExposureMaxBrightness` (lines 1994, 2002) —
  clamp the auto-exposure range (in EV100 or cd/m² depending on project setting)

For predictable results, prefer **manual exposure** over auto: set
`AutoExposureMethod` to `AEM_Manual` and fix the EV100 directly with `AutoExposureBias`.
Auto-exposure "breathes" as the camera pans, which reads as incorrect to players.

Color grading and tone curve live alongside exposure in the same struct; see
[references/shadows-and-postprocess.md](references/shadows-and-postprocess.md).

## Reflection captures (legacy / spec fill)

`UReflectionCaptureComponent` (`Components/ReflectionCaptureComponent.h:30`) and its
concrete subclasses (`USphereReflectionCaptureComponent`,
`UBoxReflectionCaptureComponent`) provide cubemap IBL for surfaces with low roughness
in areas where Lumen reflections have insufficient quality (e.g., enclosed interiors or
mobile targets). They are **not** updated at runtime by default; call
`MarkDirtyForRecaptureOrUpload()` to force a refresh.

With Lumen enabled, reflection captures are mostly replaced by Lumen Reflections for
Movable surfaces. They remain relevant for Static/Stationary geometry and as a fallback
for hardware that does not meet Lumen's requirements.

## C++ snippet — creating and configuring a light

```cpp
// In actor constructor:
#include "Components/PointLightComponent.h"

UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
TObjectPtr<UPointLightComponent> FillLight;

// Constructor body:
FillLight = CreateDefaultSubobject<UPointLightComponent>(TEXT("FillLight"));
FillLight->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
FillLight->SetIntensity(2000.f);           // lumens (with inverse-sq falloff)
FillLight->SetLightColor(FLinearColor(1.f, 0.95f, 0.8f));
FillLight->SetAttenuationRadius(600.f);
FillLight->CastShadows = true;
```

```cpp
// Runtime: change intensity and disable shadow casting
FillLight->SetIntensity(500.f);
FillLight->SetCastShadows(false);
```

Key APIs on `ULightComponent` (all `BlueprintCallable`):
- `SetIntensity(float)` — total output in the component's intensity units
- `SetLightColor(FLinearColor, bool bSRGB)` — filter tint
- `SetTemperature(float)` / `SetUseTemperature(bool)` — color temperature (Kelvin)
- `SetShadowBias(float)` / `SetShadowSlopeBias(float)` — self-shadow tuning
- `SetLightFunctionMaterial(UMaterialInterface*)` — project a material as a cookie

On `ULocalLightComponent`:
- `SetAttenuationRadius(float)` — bounding radius; affects tile-culling cost
- `SetIntensityUnits(ELightUnits)` — `Candelas`, `Lumens`, or `EV100`

## Gotchas

- **Static lights ignored by Lumen** — Lumen disables lightmap contributions; only
  Movable (and partially Stationary) lights drive dynamic GI.
- **Mesh distance fields off** — Lumen's software path silently degrades or produces
  black GI; enable in Project Settings → Rendering → Generate Mesh Distance Fields.
- **More than four overlapping Stationary lights** — fifth light degrades to Movable
  shadow cost; keep count per-area ≤ 4.
- **Auto-exposure surprise** — scenes look inconsistent as the camera moves; use
  manual exposure for cinematic or stylized work.
- **Sky Light not recapturing** — with `bRealTimeCapture = false`, the sky light bakes
  once; call `RecaptureSky()` or set `bRealTimeCapture = true` when the sky changes.
- **VSM invalidation cost** — moving or spawning many Movable meshes near shadowed
  lights forces cache invalidation; pool or batch spawn off-screen when possible.
- **Rect lights and light functions** — `URectLightComponent` does not support
  `LightFunctionMaterial` (only Directional/Point/Spot do).
- **Lightmap UVs for baked lighting** — if you fall back to Lightmass, meshes must
  have a valid lightmap UV channel or shadows bake black.

## Version notes

- Lumen is the default GI system for new UE5 projects; existing UE4 projects converted
  to UE5 do not automatically enable it (avoids breaking baked workflows).
- MegaLights (`bAllowMegaLights` on `ULightComponent`, line 171) is a UE5.5+ feature
  for stochastic many-light rendering; present in 5.8 but still experimental.
- VSMs replaced the legacy Cascaded Shadow Map default for PC/console in UE5; mobile
  platforms still use traditional shadow maps.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
