# Versioning and migration — full reference

Deep dive for [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Covers save versioning strategies, field migration
patterns, `ULocalPlayerSaveGame` versioning hooks, backward compatibility rules, and platform
considerations. Grounded in UE 5.8
(`Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Classes/GameFramework/SaveGame.h`).

## Why versioning is non-optional

UE's tagged property serializer is tolerant of **schema additions**: a property that is present
in the save but missing in the current class is silently ignored on load; a property present in
the class but absent from the save gets its C++ default value. This makes adding fields safe.

Schema **removals and renames** are not safe. The serializer matches by property name; if you
rename `Health` to `MaxHealth`, old saves load it as 0 (the default). Without a version field
you cannot detect and migrate old data.

## Version field convention

```cpp
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UMySaveGame : public USaveGame
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    // Always first; increment when schema changes in a breaking way.
    UPROPERTY() int32 SaveVersion = 1;

    // Current schema fields:
    UPROPERTY() float MaxHealth = 100.f;
    UPROPERTY() float CurrentHealth = 100.f;

    // Deprecated fields — keep for one version cycle so old saves can migrate:
    UPROPERTY() float Health_Deprecated = 0.f;  // was "Health" in v1
};
```

Override `PostLoad` to apply migrations before the rest of the game reads the data:

```cpp
void UMySaveGame::PostLoad()
{
    Super::PostLoad();

    if (SaveVersion < 2)
    {
        // v1 stored a single "Health" field; v2 splits into Max/Current.
        MaxHealth     = 100.f;
        CurrentHealth = Health_Deprecated;
        SaveVersion   = 2;
    }
    // Add further version steps as needed:
    // if (SaveVersion < 3) { ... SaveVersion = 3; }
}
```

Keep the `_Deprecated` field in the class (marked `UPROPERTY` so it still deserializes from the
old save) until no supported save version uses it, then remove it with a major version bump.

## Backward compatibility rules

| Change | Safe? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Add a new `UPROPERTY` | Yes | Missing fields default to C++ initializer value |
| Remove a `UPROPERTY` | No | Old saves carry the field; new code ignores it. No data loss, but migration is impossible after removal |
| Rename a `UPROPERTY` | No | Looks like remove + add; old value is lost without migration |
| Change a `UPROPERTY` type | No | Serialization will likely fail or corrupt; version-gate |
| Change a `USTRUCT` field | Treat as rename | USTRUCT fields follow the same rules as UPROPERTY |
| Add a new slot | Yes | Existing slots are unaffected |

## ULocalPlayerSaveGame versioning

`ULocalPlayerSaveGame` provides a structured version hook pattern:

```cpp
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UMyPlayerSave : public ULocalPlayerSaveGame
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    // Return the current schema version — increment on every breaking change.
    virtual int32 GetLatestDataVersion() const override { return 3; }

    // Called after a successful load from disk; SavedDataVersion holds
    // the version the file was written with.
    virtual void HandlePostLoad() override
    {
        Super::HandlePostLoad();

        if (GetSavedDataVersion() < 2)
        {
            // migrate v1 → v2
        }
        if (GetSavedDataVersion() < 3)
        {
            // migrate v2 → v3
        }
        // SavedDataVersion is updated to GetLatestDataVersion() automatically before save.
    }

    virtual void ResetToDefault() override
    {
        Super::ResetToDefault();
        // Set all fields back to their new-game defaults.
    }
};
```

Key `ULocalPlayerSaveGame` accessors (SaveGame.h):
- `GetSavedDataVersion()` — the version stored in the file (what it was last saved as).
- `GetLatestDataVersion()` — override to return your current version; defaults to 0.
- `GetInvalidDataVersion()` — returns -1; the initial value for a brand-new (never-saved) object.
- `WasLoaded()` — true if this instance came from disk rather than being freshly created.
- `HandlePostLoad()` — migration hook; called after load, not after create.
- `HandlePreSave()` / `HandlePostSave(bool)` — hooks around the save operation.

## Detecting first-run vs. corrupt save

```cpp
// On sync load:
UMySaveGame* Loaded = Cast<UMySaveGame>(
    UGameplayStatics::LoadGameFromSlot(TEXT("Slot0"), 0));

if (!Loaded)
{
    // Null: slot doesn't exist OR save is corrupt / class mismatch.
    // Create a fresh save:
    Loaded = Cast<UMySaveGame>(
        UGameplayStatics::CreateSaveGameObject(UMySaveGame::StaticClass()));
}
else if (Loaded->SaveVersion > CURRENT_VERSION)
{
    // Save is from a newer build — handle gracefully (warn, reset, or error).
}
```

`ISaveGameSystem::DoesSaveGameExistWithResult` returns `ESaveExistsResult::Corrupt` on some
platforms when the file exists but is unreadable. Use this to distinguish "no save" from
"corrupted save" when you need to display a different message to the player.

## Per-slot versioning for multiple profiles

When a game has multiple save slots, each slot independently tracks its version. If a player
loads an old slot and the game has been updated, migration runs for that slot. New slots start at
the current version. A reliable pattern:

- Embed `SaveVersion` at the top of every `USaveGame` subclass.
- When writing a new slot for the first time, set `SaveVersion = CURRENT_VERSION`.
- On any load, check `SaveVersion` before reading any other field.

## Platform considerations

**PC:** Saves are plain `.sav` files in `Saved/SaveGames/`; they persist between game updates as
long as the project's `Saved/` folder is not cleared. Steam Cloud Sync can replicate them to
other machines, which may introduce version skew between machines.

**Console:** Each platform's save system manages versioning independently at the OS level. The
engine's `ISaveGameSystem` wrapper handles the I/O, but you are still responsible for internal
schema versioning. Some platforms can pre-load saves to reduce perceived load time — your
`HandlePostLoad` migration will still run, so keep it fast.

**UE version upgrades:** UE's own internal serialization format may change across engine
versions. Epic handles this at the engine level (the save file header includes engine version
metadata); your `SaveVersion` field is for *your* schema, independent of the engine version.

## Enumerated version constants (recommended pattern)

```cpp
namespace ESaveVersion
{
    enum Type : int32
    {
        Initial      = 1,
        SplitHealth  = 2,   // v2: split Health → MaxHealth + CurrentHealth
        AddedGuild   = 3,   // v3: added GuildMembership array
        Latest       = AddedGuild,
    };
}
```

Use named constants instead of raw integers so migration steps are self-documenting and
reviewable. Check `SaveVersion < ESaveVersion::SplitHealth` rather than `SaveVersion < 2`.
