## Data Interface base class

`UNiagaraDataInterface` (`NiagaraDataInterface.h`) is the abstract base. All concrete DIs
derive from it and register functions that HLSL modules can call. On the CPU path those
functions are bound to C++ `VectorVM` external functions; on the GPU path they generate HLSL
that is compiled into the emitter's compute shader.

A DI is an **asset reference** carried by a User Parameter of type `Data Interface`. You bind a
concrete object (e.g. a `USkeletalMeshComponent`) at runtime either via a User Parameter or via
a `UNiagaraFunctionLibrary` helper.

## Data Interface catalog (UE 5.8)

| Neighbor Grid 3D | Voxel spatial hash; neighbor queries for flocking, fluid |
| Grid 2D/3D Collection | General 2D/3D array storage on the GPU; fluid simulations |
| Niagara Data Channel | Cross-system particle communication (see below) |

## Binding DIs from C++

```cpp
// Bind a skeletal mesh component to a DI User Parameter named "CharacterMesh":
UNiagaraFunctionLibrary::OverrideSystemUserVariableSkeletalMeshComponent(
    FX,                   // UNiagaraComponent*
    TEXT("CharacterMesh"),
    GetMesh());           // USkeletalMeshComponent*

// Bind a static mesh component to a DI User Parameter named "Surface":
UNiagaraFunctionLibrary::OverrideSystemUserVariableStaticMeshComponent(
    FX, TEXT("Surface"), GroundMesh);

// Bind a texture:
UNiagaraFunctionLibrary::SetTextureObject(
    FX, TEXT("MaskTex"), MyTexture2D);
```

These helpers write to the component's override parameter store; the DI is updated on the next
tick. The DI name must match the User Parameter name exactly.

## Niagara Data Channels (5.3+)

Data Channels (`NiagaraDataChannel.h`) allow multiple Niagara Systems to share data without
direct component coupling. One system writes particle data to a named channel; another system
reads from it in the same or next frame.

```cpp
// Access a Data Channel from C++ (typically via UNiagaraDataChannelFunctionLibrary):
#include "NiagaraDataChannelFunctionLibrary.h"

// Begin a write of one element to a channel asset; fill fields via the returned writer:
UNiagaraDataChannelWriter* Writer = UNiagaraDataChannelFunctionLibrary::WriteToNiagaraDataChannel(
    this,
    ExplosionsChannel,                      // UNiagaraDataChannelAsset*
    FNiagaraDataChannelSearchParameters(),  // locates where the data lands in the world
    /*Count*/ 1,
    /*bVisibleToGame*/ true, /*bVisibleToCPU*/ true, /*bVisibleToGPU*/ true,
    TEXT("MyGame"));
```

Data Channels are primarily a gameplay-to-Niagara bus. For cross-system communication within
the same world, they replace the older approach of reading actor positions via DIs.

## CPU vs GPU: detailed trade-offs

### CPU emitter

- Simulates on the game thread via the VectorVM (vectorized CPU runtime).
- Per-particle data is accessible to gameplay: you can read `Particle.Position`,
  listen for Niagara events, trigger Blueprint callbacks.
- Collision uses `UWorld::LineTrace*`, which respects full physics (complex collision,
  procedural meshes, destructibles).
- Scales to ~tens of thousands of particles before game-thread cost becomes significant.
- Use `stat Niagara` → `NiagaraGameThread_*` counters to measure.

### GPU emitter

- Simulates on the render thread as a compute shader via the `FNiagaraGpuComputeDispatchInterface`.
- Game thread has no direct access to per-GPU-particle data; there is no per-particle event
  callback from GPU emitters to gameplay.
- Collision is limited to distance-field, depth-buffer, or HWRT (5.3+). No complex-mesh traces.
- Supports millions of particles; the only game-thread overhead is the dispatch call.
- Use `stat Niagara` → `NiagaraRenderThread_*` and Unreal Insights GPU track.

### Mixed systems

A single `UNiagaraSystem` can contain both CPU and GPU emitters. Emitters do not share particle
data across the CPU/GPU boundary directly. Use Data Channels or User Parameters to pass
information from CPU emitters to GPU emitters (e.g. passing the player position as a User
Parameter so GPU particles can repel from the player).

## Scalability and culling

Niagara integrates with the scalability system via `UNiagaraEffectType` assets assigned to each
`UNiagaraSystem`. The effect type defines:

- **Visibility culling** — cull if occluded for N ms.
- **Distance culling** — cull beyond a world-space radius.
- **Instance count limiting** — cap the number of concurrent instances.
- **Quality levels** — reduce particle counts or disable emitters at lower scalability tiers.

The `UNiagaraComponent::SetAllowScalability(false)` call exempts a specific component from
culling (e.g. first-person effects or locally important player VFX).

`SpawnSystemAtLocation`/`SpawnSystemAttached` with `bPreCullCheck = true` apply the system's
effect type rules **before** allocating the component; they return `nullptr` if the effect would
be immediately culled. This avoids the cost of spawning an effect that the engine would cull
on the first tick.

## The Niagara Debugger

The Niagara Debugger (editor: Window → Niagara Debugger, or `showdebug niagara` in-game)
provides:

- Live particle count and simulation time per system instance.
- Parameter store inspection — read active User Parameter values.
- Emitter enable/disable toggles for isolating behaviors.
- GPU dispatch counts and timing.
- Scalability state for each active component.

`stat Niagara` in the console gives aggregate timing. For deeper profiling, Unreal Insights
(CPU track: `NiagaraGameThread`, GPU track: compute dispatches) shows the full call chain.

## Common performance mistakes

- **CPU emitter with thousands of particles** — VectorVM scales but each batch is a
  game-thread synchronization point. Profile with `stat Niagara`; switch to GPU at ~10k+.
- **Many distinct system instances** — each instance has per-tick overhead independent of
  particle count. Pool small-burst effects with `ENCPoolMethod::AutoRelease`.
- **Unbound skeletal mesh DI** — if the DI's mesh reference is null, the emitter may spawn
  zero particles or assert. Always ensure the DI binding is set before `Activate()`.
- **GPU emitter requesting gameplay collision** — distance-field only; no complex-collision
  support on GPU. Use CPU if you need exact collision response.
- **Unlimited instances** — without an `UNiagaraEffectType`, there is no instance cap.
  Assign an effect type to all systems that may be spawned repeatedly.
