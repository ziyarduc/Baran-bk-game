# Gameplay framework

The gameplay framework is the set of base classes Unreal spawns and wires together to run a
game. Choosing the *right* class for each piece of logic is the single most important design
decision in UE gameplay code.

## When to use this skill

- Creating a new game mode, game state, player controller, pawn, player state, or HUD class.
- Implementing player login, spawn, respawn, or possession logic.
- Deciding where a piece of state lives (server-only vs replicated vs per-player vs cross-level).
- Setting up default classes in C++ and exposing them to designers via Blueprint subclasses.
- Wiring the spawn/possession flow or implementing a match-state machine.

## The classes and their roles

| Class | Lives where | Core responsibility | Replicated? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UGameInstance` | one per game, persists across level loads | app-lifetime state, subsystems, online sessions | no |
| `AGameModeBase` | **server only** | rules, default classes, login/spawn flow | no |
| `AGameMode` | **server only** | adds match-state machine on top of Base | no |
| `AGameStateBase` | server + all clients | game-wide visible state (score, timer, match phase) | yes |
| `AGameState` | server + all clients | adds `MatchState` replication to Base | yes |
| `APlayerController` | server + owning client | input, camera, UI, possession bridge | to owner only |
| `APlayerState` | server + all clients | per-player replicated data (name, score, team) | yes |
| `APawn` | server + clients | physical avatar in the world | yes |
| `ACharacter` | server + clients | bipedal pawn with movement, capsule, skeletal mesh | yes |
| `AHUD` | owning client only | legacy canvas overlay (prefer UMG for real UI) | local |

Class hierarchy (verified in 5.8 source):
- `AGameModeBase : public AInfo` (`GameModeBase.h`:47); `AGameMode : public AGameModeBase` (`GameMode.h`:35).
- `AGameStateBase : public AInfo` (`GameStateBase.h`:32); `AGameState : public AGameStateBase` (`GameState.h`:16).
- `APlayerController : public AController` (`PlayerController.h`:262); `AController : public AActor` (`Controller.h`:40).
- `APawn : public AActor` (`Pawn.h`:43); `ACharacter : public APawn` (`Character.h`:338).
- `APlayerState : public AInfo` (`PlayerState.h`:41); `AHUD : public AActor` (`HUD.h`:36).
- `UGameInstance : public UObject, public FExec` (`Engine/GameInstance.h`:151).

**Base vs non-base:** `AGameModeBase` and `AGameStateBase` are the lean modern defaults.
`AGameMode`/`AGameState` add the match-state machine (`MatchState`, `WaitingToStart`,
`InProgress`, `WaitingPostMatch`, …) inherited from UE3-era multiplayer. Start from `*Base`
unless you need match states.

## Ownership and relationship map

```
UGameInstance (persists across levels)
└── UWorld (current level)
    ├── AGameModeBase       (server only — rules and spawning)
    ├── AGameStateBase      (replicated — global visible state)
    │   └── PlayerArray: TArray<APlayerState*>   (one per connected player, replicated)
    └── per player:
        APlayerController ──possesses──> APawn / ACharacter
              │                              └── movement, mesh, collision components
              └── PlayerState  (also in GameState.PlayerArray)
```

Key accessors verified in 5.8 source:
- `GetWorld()->GetGameState<T>()` — replicated on all machines.
- `GetWorld()->GetAuthGameMode<T>()` — **server only**; returns null on clients.
- `GetGameInstance<T>()` — available via any `UObject` with a valid outer chain.
- `AController::GetPawn()` (`Controller.h`:233); `APawn::GetController()` (`Pawn.h`:264).
- `APawn::GetPlayerState<T>()` (`Pawn.h`:193); `AController::PlayerState` (`Controller.h`:50).

## Server spawn and login flow

On the server, `AGameModeBase` drives the sequence when a player joins:

1. `InitGame` (`GameModeBase.h`:62) — called before any actor `PreInitializeComponents`; spawn helper classes here.
2. `PreLogin` (`GameModeBase.h`:293) — reject players by setting `ErrorMessage` before any state is allocated.
3. `Login` (`GameModeBase.h`:323) — creates and returns the `APlayerController`; spawns `APlayerState`.
4. `PostLogin(PC)` (`GameModeBase.h`:326) — first safe place to call replicated functions on the PC.
5. `HandleStartingNewPlayer(PC)` (`GameModeBase.h`:361) — override in Blueprint or C++ to control what happens next.
6. `RestartPlayer(PC)` (`GameModeBase.h`:435) → `FindPlayerStart` → `SpawnDefaultPawnAtTransform` → `PC->Possess(Pawn)`.

Full login flow with seamless travel and `OnPostLogin` details:
[references/init-and-login-flow.md](references/init-and-login-flow.md).

## Possession

`AController::Possess(APawn*)` is `final` in 5.8; override `OnPossess` instead
(`Controller.h`:299). The symmetric unpossess override is `OnUnPossess` (`Controller.h`:306).

```cpp
// Override OnPossess to react to possession — NOT Possess() which is final
void AMyController::OnPossess(APawn* InPawn)
{
    Super::OnPossess(InPawn);
    // Safe to access InPawn here; PlayerState is already assigned
}

// On the pawn side, PossessedBy fires when a controller takes control
void AMyPawn::PossessedBy(AController* NewController)
{
    Super::PossessedBy(NewController);
    // Bind abilities, movement, etc. that depend on the controller
}
```

A controller can possess different pawns over its lifetime (death/respawn, vehicle enter/exit).
Do not store gameplay state on the pawn that must survive across possessions — use `PlayerState`
or `PlayerController` instead.

## Setting default classes in C++

```cpp
// MyGameMode.h
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    AMyGameMode();
};

// MyGameMode.cpp
#include "MyGameMode.h"
#include "MyCharacter.h"
#include "MyPlayerController.h"
#include "MyPlayerState.h"
#include "MyGameState.h"

AMyGameMode::AMyGameMode()
{
    DefaultPawnClass       = AMyCharacter::StaticClass();
    PlayerControllerClass  = AMyPlayerController::StaticClass();
    PlayerStateClass       = AMyPlayerState::StaticClass();
    GameStateClass         = AMyGameState::StaticClass();
    // HUDClass — set if you use legacy AHUD; omit for pure UMG
}
```

These five `TSubclassOf<>` properties are declared on `AGameModeBase` with
`EditAnywhere, NoClear, BlueprintReadOnly` (`GameModeBase.h`:87–108). Assign them in the
constructor so Blueprint subclasses can still override them in Blueprints editor defaults.

Then wire the GameMode per-project (Project Settings → Maps & Modes →
`DefaultGameMode`/`GlobalDefaultGameMode` in `DefaultEngine.ini`
`[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]`), or per-level (World Settings → GameMode Override).

## Where does my logic go? (decision guide)

| Logic | Belongs in |
|---|---|
| Rules, win/lose, who spawns where, scoring authority | `AGameModeBase` — server only |
| State everyone must see (scores, timer, match phase) | `AGameStateBase` / `AGameState` |
| Per-player replicated facts (name, team, kills) | `APlayerState` |
| Input handling, camera, opening menus, player intent | `APlayerController` |
| Physical movement, abilities of the avatar | `APawn` / `ACharacter` + components |
| Cross-level or app-lifetime (save game, audio settings, online session) | `UGameInstance` / a `UGameInstanceSubsystem` |

If it must survive a level load → `UGameInstance` or `UGameInstanceSubsystem`
(see `subsystems`). If only the server may decide it → `AGameModeBase`.

## GameInstance and subsystems

`UGameInstance` is created once on engine launch and destroyed when the application exits,
surviving all level transitions. Override `Init` (`GameInstance.h`:217) and
`Shutdown` (`GameInstance.h`:224) for setup/teardown. Access it from any actor via
`GetGameInstance<UMyGameInstance>()`.

For modular, dependency-isolated systems with the same lifetime:

```cpp
// Subsystem declared as UCLASS(), auto-created by GameInstance
class UMyOnlineSubsystem : public UGameInstanceSubsystem
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    virtual void Initialize(FSubsystemCollectionBase& Collection) override;
    virtual void Deinitialize() override;
};

// Access from any actor
UMyOnlineSubsystem* Sub = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UMyOnlineSubsystem>();
```

`GetSubsystem<T>()` is declared on `UGameInstance` (`GameInstance.h`:440). See `subsystems`.

## PlayerState — per-player replicated data

`APlayerState` is created by `Login` and added to `AGameStateBase::PlayerArray`. It replicates
to all clients, making it the correct place for data every machine needs about each player.

```cpp
// MyPlayerState.h
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyPlayerState : public APlayerState
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UPROPERTY(Replicated, BlueprintReadOnly, Category=Player)
    int32 TeamIndex = 0;

    virtual void GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(
        TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const override;
};
```

Built-in replicated fields on `APlayerState`: `Score` (getter `GetScore`, setter `SetScore`,
`PlayerState.h`:312/318), `PlayerNamePrivate` (accessed via `GetPlayerName`/`SetPlayerName`,
`PlayerState.h`:235/228), `PlayerId`, `CompressedPing`, `bIsSpectator`, `bIsABot`.

## Network roles

- `AGameModeBase` exists **only on the server**; never put client logic there.
- `AGameStateBase`/`APlayerState` are replicated — read on any machine, only write on server.
- `APlayerController` replicates to its owning client only — good for client RPCs and UI.
- `APawn`/`ACharacter` replicate to all clients; `HasAuthority()` determines who may change state.
- Use `HasAuthority()` or `GetLocalRole() == ROLE_Authority` to branch server vs client.

See `networking-and-replication` for property/RPC mechanics.

## C++ base + Blueprint subclass pattern

The idiomatic setup:
- Put logic, replicated state, and core API in C++ (`AMyGameMode`, `AMyCharacter`, …).
- Expose designer-facing defaults via Blueprint subclasses (`BP_GameMode`, `BP_Character`, …).
- Set the BP subclasses as defaults in Project Settings or World Settings.
- Use `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly)` for numbers/assets designers should tweak without requiring
  recompile. See `blueprint-cpp-integration`.

## Gotchas

- **`GetAuthGameMode()` on a client** returns null; always guard with `HasAuthority()`.
- **`Possess` is `final`** since UE 4.22; override `OnPossess`/`OnUnPossess` (`Controller.h`:299/306).
- **Persistent state on the Pawn** is lost on death/respawn; use `APlayerState` or `APlayerController`.
- **Possession ≠ spawn**: a controller can possess different pawns over time; don't assume 1:1 lifetime.
- **`AGameMode` vs `AGameModeBase` mismatch**: `MatchState` machinery only exists in `AGameMode`;
  don't reference it from an `AGameModeBase` subclass.
- **`DispatchPostLogin` deprecated in 5.6**: override `OnPostLogin(AController*)` instead
  (`GameModeBase.h`:334 — note the UE_DEPRECATED annotation at :329).
- **HUD for modern UI**: `AHUD` is legacy canvas drawing; build real UI with UMG (see `umg-and-slate`).
- **`APlayerState` outlives the pawn**: the state persists in `GameState.PlayerArray` even when
  the pawn is destroyed; that is by design so scores survive death.
- **GameInstance is not replicated**: the server and each client each have their own independent
  instance. Do not use it as a shared-state store in multiplayer.

## Version notes

- `AGameModeBase` introduced in UE 4.14; older projects may subclass `AGameMode` directly.
- `Possess`/`UnPossess` marked `virtual final` in UE 4.22; use `OnPossess`/`OnUnPossess`.
- `DispatchPostLogin` deprecated in UE 5.6; the replacement is `OnPostLogin` (protected virtual).
- The framework is stable across UE 5.x; line numbers in citations drift between patch releases
  but header paths and class names are stable.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).

### Domain Adaptation: Gameplay Framework & GameModes
- **Dual GameModes**:
  1. `ABRGameMode_FFA`: Free-For-All deathmatch with score/kill limit and match countdown timer.
  2. `ABRGameMode_BR`: Classic Battle Royale with 7-phase shrinking storm circle and Last Man Standing victory condition.
- **Solo BR Architecture**: `ABRGameState` and `ABRPlayerState` track individual players and bots only. No squad structures, team IDs, or shared inventories.
- **10-Bot Match Loop**: Server spawns 1 player and 10 bots across outdoor spawn points.
- **Server Authority**: All state transitions (match state, storm phase, score, eliminations) execute strictly on the server.
