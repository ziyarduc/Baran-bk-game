description: UE5.6-UE5.8 Blueprint graph workflow for feature implementation, input events, node wiring, and graph validation. Use when requests involve adding Blueprint logic, keyboard input behavior, function chains, event graph edits, or pin-level connection guidance.
---

# Quick Start
- Identify target Blueprint asset and graph (`EventGraph` or function graph).
- Confirm requested behavior as event -> logic -> output chain.
- Decide input route first: legacy key event or Enhanced Input action event.
- Produce graph-level steps first, then exact node/pin wiring details.

# API Anchors (UE5.6-UE5.8)
- Keyboard and event node anchors:
  - `UK2Node_InputKey`, `UK2Node_InputAction`, `UK2Node_InputActionEvent`
  - `UK2Node_CallFunction`, `UK2Node_CustomEvent`
- Enhanced Input anchors:
  - `UInputAction`, `UInputMappingContext`
  - `UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem::AddMappingContext(...)`
  - `UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem::RemoveMappingContext(...)`
  - `UEnhancedInputComponent::BindAction(...)`
- Tool fast-path anchors (preferred for Blueprint editing automation):
  - `blueprint_modify` with `operation=add_input_key_event`
  - `blueprint_modify` with `operation=connect_pins`
  - `blueprint_query` for pin inspection and compile checks

# Graph Stage Contract
- Every requested Blueprint feature must specify:
  - Entry event source (key/input action/custom event)
  - Core logic nodes (minimum two meaningful nodes)
  - Required pin-level connections (exec and data pins)
  - Output/side effects (state change, call, spawn, UI)
  - Validation method (compile status, node/pin inspection, expected execution order)
- If any item is missing, the graph implementation is incomplete.

# Workflow
## 1) Entry Event
- Keyboard requests: use `add_input_key_event` first with `reuse_existing=true`.
- Enhanced Input requests: add/reuse Input Action event nodes (`UK2Node_InputActionEvent` path).
- Do not perform generic event-node guessing before trying dedicated input operations.

## 2) Core Logic Chain
- Build minimal deterministic logic with explicit control flow (`Branch`, `Sequence`, function calls).
- Prefer existing graph variables/functions over creating redundant nodes.
- Keep one clear execution path per behavior branch.

## 3) Pin Wiring
- Connect exec pins before data pins to lock execution order.
- Inspect exact pin names via `blueprint_query` before `connect_pins`.
- Avoid ambiguous autowiring when multiple overload pins exist.

## 4) State/Output
- Apply state updates (variables/tags), then side effects (spawn/call/UI feedback).
- Keep output nodes isolated by intent to simplify later debugging.
- When both success/fail paths exist, wire both explicitly.

## 5) Validation and Summary
- Validate compile state and pin integrity after wiring.
- Confirm there are no duplicate input nodes for the same key/action.
- Summarize final chain in deterministic order: entry -> branch -> action -> output.

# Constraints
- Mandatory hotkey rule: use `add_input_key_event` first for keyboard features.
- Keep `reuse_existing=true` for key events to avoid duplicates.
- Avoid trial-and-error node class guessing when a dedicated operation exists.
- Separate graph steps from pin-level detail in final output.
- Prefer Enhanced Input assets (`UInputAction`/`UInputMappingContext`) for new input systems.
- Avoid hidden behavior in latent/timer nodes unless explicitly requested.

# Failure Handling
- Symptom: key press does not fire.
  - Locate: input node type, duplicated key nodes, input focus/context.
  - Fix: reuse/create via `add_input_key_event`, remove duplicates, verify mapping context path.
- Symptom: graph compiles with warnings but behavior is wrong.
  - Locate: branch conditions and exec pin order.
  - Fix: reorder exec chain and verify condition data pins.
- Symptom: pin connection fails in automation.
  - Locate: node variant pin names or overload mismatch.
  - Fix: run `blueprint_query` to inspect exact pins before wiring.
- Symptom: Enhanced Input event exists but never triggers.
  - Locate: mapping context registration and action binding path.
  - Fix: ensure mapping context is added and action event node matches action asset.
- Symptom: event fires multiple times unexpectedly.
  - Locate: duplicate entry nodes or repeated binding paths.
  - Fix: consolidate to one entry node and guard re-entrant path with state flags.
- Symptom: graph no longer compiles after edits.
  - Locate: broken links after node replacement or stale function signatures.
  - Fix: reconnect required pins and refresh function node signatures.

# UE5.6-UE5.8 Compatibility Notes
- Core Blueprint graph nodes above are stable across UE5.6-UE5.8.
- UE5.8 adds an Enhanced Input UI Input Debugger; use it when available, while keeping log and mapping-context checks valid for 5.6/5.7.
- Prefer Enhanced Input path for new implementations across all supported versions.

# Escalation
- Escalate when behavior requires C++ extension, custom latent nodes, or engine plugin changes.
- Escalate when Blueprint is locked, corrupted, or cannot compile due to unrelated project errors.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
