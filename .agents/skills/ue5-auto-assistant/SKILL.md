name: ue5-auto-assistant
description: UE5.6-UE5.8 automatic assistant entry for beginners. Use when users ask Unreal questions without naming a specific skill. Auto-route to the most precise UE5 skill and recommend dedicated MCP tools.
---

# Quick Start
- Treat this as the default entry for UE5.6-UE5.8 requests.
- Parse user intent first without requiring module names.
- Route to `ue5-module-router` when module-level precision is needed.

# Workflow
- Detect request type: Blueprint, C++, UI, save/load, networking, world interaction, PCG/procedural generation, debugging, performance, packaging.
- If module names appear, delegate routing to `ue5-module-router`.
- If module names do not appear, route by intent:
  - Blueprint -> `ue5-blueprint-workflow`
  - C++ gameplay -> `ue5-cpp-gameplay`
  - UI/UMG/Slate -> `ue5-ui-umg-slate`
  - save/load/replication -> `ue5-save-load-replication`
  - pickup/spawner/world interaction -> `ue5-world-interaction`
  - PCG/procedural building/shape grammar -> `ue5-pcg-building`
  - perf/packaging -> `ue5-performance-packaging`
  - debugging/validation -> `ue5-debug-validation`
  - architecture/refactor -> `ue5-architecture`
- Return one primary skill and optional secondary skill for cross-domain requests.
- Return routing payload fields:
  - `primary_skill`
  - `secondary_skill`
  - `recommended_mcp_tools[]`
  - `route_confidence`
  - `route_reason`

# Natural Language To Skill And Tools
- Blueprint requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-blueprint-workflow`
  - recommended tools: `blueprint_feature_build`, `blueprint_modify`, `blueprint_query`
- C++ gameplay/system requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-cpp-gameplay`
  - recommended tools: `blueprint_query`, `asset_search`, `get_output_log`
- UI/UMG/Slate requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-ui-umg-slate`
  - recommended tools: `blueprint_query`, `blueprint_modify`, `capture_viewport`
- Save/load/replication requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-save-load-replication`
  - recommended tools: `character_data`, `blueprint_query`, `get_output_log`
- World interaction/pickup/spawner requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-world-interaction`
  - recommended tools: `spawn_actor`, `get_level_actors`, `set_property`, `move_actor`
- PCG/procedural building requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-pcg-building`
  - recommended tools: `asset_search`, `blueprint_query`, `get_output_log`, `capture_viewport`
- Performance/packaging requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-performance-packaging`
  - recommended tools: `run_console_command`, `get_output_log`, `capture_viewport`, `open_level`
- Debug/validation requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-debug-validation`
  - recommended tools: `get_output_log`, `asset_search`, `blueprint_query`, `task_list`
- Architecture/module-boundary requests:
  - target skill: `ue5-architecture`
  - recommended tools: `asset_search`, `asset_dependencies`, `asset_referencers`

# Constraints
- Do not require users to know skill names.
- Prefer deterministic routing with explicit reason.
- Keep fallback behavior explicit when confidence is low.
- Prefer dedicated MCP tools before `execute_script`.

# Failure Handling
- If intent is ambiguous, return top 2 route candidates and ask one short clarification.
- If request spans many systems, split into staged route steps.
- Clarification template:
  - `Quick check: do you want A(<candidate_1>) or B(<candidate_2>)?`
  - ask once, then continue.

# Escalation
- Escalate when query depends on plugin/engine source outside indexed scope.
- Escalate when org-level coding standards are required but not available in repo.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
