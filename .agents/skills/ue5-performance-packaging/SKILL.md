description: UE5.6-UE5.8 performance and packaging readiness workflow. Use when requests involve PIE performance checks, runtime stat review, pre-package validation, build configuration sanity, and release readiness checklists.
---

# Quick Start
- Confirm target platform and build configuration.
- Collect current performance symptoms and packaging goal.
- Output a pre-package checklist plus measurement plan.

# API Anchors (UE5.6-UE5.8)
- Runtime quality and frame-budget anchors:
  - `UGameUserSettings::SetOverallScalabilityLevel(...)`
  - `UGameUserSettings::SetFrameRateLimit(...)`
  - `UGameUserSettings::ApplySettings(...)`
- Packaging settings anchors:
  - `UProjectPackagingSettings`
  - `BuildConfiguration`, `MapsToCook`, `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook`
  - `UsePakFile`, `bUseIoStore`, `bGenerateChunks`
- Asset dependency validation anchors:
  - `FAssetRegistryModule`, `IAssetRegistry`
  - `GetAssetsByPath(...)`
  - `GetDependencies(...)`, `GetReferencers(...)`
- Profiling instrumentation anchors:
  - `TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE(...)`
  - `DECLARE_CYCLE_STAT(...)`
- Practical runtime stat commands:
  - `stat unit`, `stat gpu`, `stat scenerendering`, `memreport -full`

# Performance and Packaging Contract
- Every performance/packaging task must define:
  - target platform + build config + test map
  - reproducible capture scenario (camera path, duration, net mode)
  - baseline metrics and acceptance thresholds
  - packaging configuration set and dependency scan scope
  - go/no-go output with explicit blockers
- If any item is missing, readiness evaluation is incomplete.

# Workflow
## 1) Reproducible Baseline Capture
- Freeze test map, camera path, scalability, and net mode.
- Capture `stat unit` and `stat gpu` under same scenario repeatedly.
- Use median or percentile metrics, not single-frame spikes.

## 2) Hotspot Isolation
- Identify top-cost gameplay/render systems in the capture window.
- Correlate high-cost actors/assets with scene context.
- Add scoped CPU markers for custom systems when attribution is unclear.

## 3) Asset and Dependency Validation
- Scan target paths for missing or broken asset references.
- Query dependencies and referencers for problematic assets.
- Validate required map/game mode assets are included in package scope.

## 4) Packaging Configuration Validation
- Check `UProjectPackagingSettings` fields for target release policy.
- Validate maps-to-cook, always-cook directories, and build configuration.
- Validate Pak/IoStore/chunk strategy against distribution requirements.

## 5) Package Readiness Trial
- Run pre-package checklist and dry-run style verification.
- Isolate first blocking packaging error and dependency chain.
- Record unresolved blockers with owner and risk.

## 6) Go/No-Go Decision
- Approve only when metrics and packaging checks meet thresholds.
- Report remaining risks and recommended mitigation actions.
- Lock scenario and settings used for sign-off evidence.

# Constraints
- Do not claim optimization wins without measurable before/after data.
- Keep profiling scenario reproducible (map, camera path, net mode).
- Distinguish editor overhead from packaged runtime behavior.
- Avoid changing quality scalability settings without reporting it.
- Keep packaging checks deterministic; avoid ad-hoc config toggles during sign-off.
- Always report metric units (ms, fps, memory) and capture duration.

# Failure Handling
- Symptom: performance data is noisy across runs.
  - Locate: non-deterministic scenario setup and background variance.
  - Fix: lock scenario, warm up run, and compare median/percentile values.
- Symptom: optimization claims do not reproduce.
  - Locate: mismatched quality settings, map, or runtime mode.
  - Fix: publish exact capture config and rerun before/after under same conditions.
- Symptom: package build fails with long error cascade.
  - Locate: first blocking error and its direct dependency chain.
  - Fix: resolve earliest blocker first; rerun to reveal next blockers.
- Symptom: packaged build launches with missing assets.
  - Locate: cook list coverage and dependency graph gaps.
  - Fix: include missing maps/directories and resolve broken references.
- Symptom: packaged build perf is worse than PIE baseline.
  - Locate: packaged-only config differences and runtime content path.
  - Fix: compare packaged config to baseline and align scalability/device settings.
- Symptom: memory usage regresses near content-heavy scenes.
  - Locate: high-memory assets and streaming policy behavior.
  - Fix: reduce resident asset pressure and adjust streaming/cook strategy.

# Packaging Ops
- Prefer explicit map/cook lists over implicit discovery for release builds.
- Use AssetRegistry queries to validate dependencies before packaging.
- Keep one source of truth for release packaging settings per target profile.
- In UE5.8, treat Zenserver cooked output as an iteration store; keep Pak/IoStore staging validation for distributable builds.
- Treat UE5.8 Incremental Cooking as a beta iteration path and retain a clean/full-cook release check.
- Re-run readiness checks after any packaging setting change.

# UE5.6-UE5.8 Compatibility Notes
- `UGameUserSettings`, `UProjectPackagingSettings`, and AssetRegistry APIs above are stable in UE5.6-UE5.8.
- `ProjectPackagingSettings.h` lives under `Developer/DeveloperToolSettings` across UE5.6-UE5.8.
- UE5.8 enables Zenserver as the cooked output store by default for supported iteration workflows; this does not replace release container validation.

# Escalation
- Escalate when performance bottleneck requires engine-level profiling or renderer changes.
- Escalate when packaging issues stem from third-party plugin build failures.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
