# Landscape & foliage

Three complementary systems cover terrain and environment population:

| System | Actor / Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Landscape | `ALandscape` → `ULandscapeComponent` | Heightmap terrain with painted weight layers and splines |
| Foliage / HISM | `AInstancedFoliageActor` → HISM | Hand-painted instanced vegetation at low draw-call cost |
| PCG | `UPCGComponent` + `UPCGGraph` | Rule-based graph pipeline for procedural placement |

## When to use this skill

- Creating, sculpting, or importing a heightmap landscape; tuning component/section sizes.
- Authoring landscape materials with `Layer Blend` nodes and `ULandscapeLayerInfoObject`s.
- Painting foliage (`UFoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh`) onto terrain or meshes; tuning
  density, culling, collision, and scalability.
- Adding landscape splines (`ALandscapeSplineActor`) for roads/rivers/paths.
- Enabling Nanite on a landscape (`bEnableNanite`).
- Authoring or extending a PCG graph from C++ — subclassing `UPCGSettings`, querying
  `UPCGData`, calling `Generate()`/`Cleanup()` from code.
- Debugging foliage not rendering, PCG not generating, landscape layer info missing.

## Landscape

### Class hierarchy

`ALandscape` extends `ALandscapeProxy` (which itself extends `APartitionActor`). The proxy
holds the component grid, material, and dimension metadata. `ALandscape` is the authoritative
root; large landscapes in World Partition spawn `ALandscapeStreamingProxy` instances to load
per-region.

```
ALandscape : ALandscapeProxy : APartitionActor
                  └── TArray<ULandscapeComponent*> LandscapeComponents  (LandscapeProxy.h:682)
                  └── UMaterialInterface* LandscapeMaterial             (LandscapeProxy.h:604)
                  └── int32 ComponentSizeQuads                          (LandscapeProxy.h:924)
                  └── int32 SubsectionSizeQuads                         (LandscapeProxy.h:927)
                  └── int32 NumSubsections                              (LandscapeProxy.h:930)
                  └── bool  bEnableNanite                               (LandscapeProxy.h:491)
```

`ULandscapeComponent` (`LandscapeComponent.h`:431) extends `UPrimitiveComponent` — it is
the renderable, collidable unit of terrain.

### Heightmap dimensions

Landscape dimensions are not arbitrary. Each component contains `NumSubsections × NumSubsections`
sections, each `SubsectionSizeQuads` quads wide. Total landscape quads in one axis is
`NumComponents × ComponentSizeQuads`. The corresponding heightmap vertex count is
`(NumComponents × ComponentSizeQuads) + 1`. Common valid size: 8129 × 8129 vertices
(32 × 32 components, 4 sections/component, 63 quads/section). Heights are stored as 16-bit
values mapping to ±256 m at default Z scale 100.

### Material layers and `ULandscapeLayerInfoObject`

Each paintable weight layer requires a `ULandscapeLayerInfoObject` data asset
(`LandscapeLayerInfoObject.h`:59) paired with a `LandscapeLayerBlend` node in the landscape
material. Layer weights are stored per-component in weightmap textures.

```cpp
// Reading landscape layer weight at runtime (C++ — editor or runtime with proper setup):
// ULandscapeInfo::GetLayerWeightAtLocation is the key query path.
// ULandscapeLayerInfoObject holds PhysicalMaterial and layer blend settings.
```

**Edit Layers** (`LandscapeEditLayer.h`) allow non-destructive stacking of sculpt/paint
operations — each edit layer renders additively/subtractively into the final heightmap.

### Landscape splines

`ALandscapeSplineActor` (`LandscapeSplineActor.h`:14) owns a `ULandscapeSplinesComponent`
containing control points and segments. Splines deform terrain beneath them (raise/lower)
and optionally spawn static meshes along their length as decoration or road surfaces.

### Nanite landscape

Set `bEnableNanite = true` on the `ALandscapeProxy` to render the landscape as a Nanite
mesh on supported platforms. The engine generates and maintains a `ULandscapeNaniteComponent`
alongside the traditional LOD components. LOD settings under `NaniteLODIndex` control the
source LOD used for Nanite mesh generation (default 0). See `nanite-and-rendering`.

## Foliage (instanced placement)

### Class hierarchy

```
UFoliageType (abstract, UObject)              — FoliageType.h:105
  └── UFoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh        — FoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh.h:13
  └── UFoliageType_Actor                      — FoliageType_Actor.h
AInstancedFoliageActor : AISMPartitionActor   — InstancedFoliageActor.h:28
UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent     — HierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent.h:135
  (extends UInstancedStaticMeshComponent)
```

`AInstancedFoliageActor` stores a `TMap<UFoliageType*, FFoliageInfo>` and manages the
underlying HISM instances. One `AInstancedFoliageActor` per world-partition cell holds all
foliage painted in that cell.

### UFoliageType key properties (FoliageType.h)

| Property | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Density` | Instances per 1000 × 1000 UU area |
| `Radius` | Minimum spacing between instances |
| `Scaling` / `ScaleX/Y/Z` | Random scale ranges per axis |
| `AlignToNormal` | Tilt instance to match surface normal |
| `GroundSlopeAngle` | Valid placement slope range |
| `LandscapeLayers` | Restrict painting to named weight layers |
| `CullDistance` | Per-instance screen-size cull |

### HISM internals

`UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent` builds a BVH cluster tree over its instances
(`ClusterTreePtr`, `FClusterNode`). Rendering culls entire clusters with a single check.
Adding/removing instances invalidates the tree; `BuildTreeIfOutdated(bool Async, bool Force)`
triggers a rebuild (synchronous or async).

Key API (HierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent.h):
- `AddInstance(Transform, bWorldSpace)`:303 — add one instance; returns index.
- `AddInstances(Transforms, bReturnIndices, bWorldSpace)`:304 — batch add.
- `RemoveInstance(Index)`:305 / `RemoveInstances(Indices)`:306 — remove by index.
- `UpdateInstanceTransform(Index, NewTransform, bWorldSpace, bMarkDirty, bTeleport)`:308.
- `BuildTreeIfOutdated(Async, ForceUpdate)`:330 — explicit rebuild trigger.

```cpp
// Batch-adding foliage instances from C++ (illustrative):
UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent* HISM = NewObject<UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent>(this);
HISM->SetStaticMesh(TreeMesh);
HISM->RegisterComponent();

TArray<FTransform> Transforms;
for (const FVector& Pos : SpawnPositions)
{
    FTransform T(FRotator(0, FMath::RandRange(0.f, 360.f), 0),
                 Pos,
                 FVector(FMath::RandRange(0.8f, 1.2f)));
    Transforms.Add(T);
}
HISM->AddInstances(Transforms, /*bShouldReturnIndices=*/false, /*bWorldSpace=*/true);
// Tree rebuilds async after the next tick; forcing sync:
HISM->BuildTreeIfOutdated(/*Async=*/false, /*ForceUpdate=*/true);
```

### Procedural foliage volumes

`UProceduralFoliageComponent` (`ProceduralFoliageComponent.h`:42) is placed on a volume
actor and references a `UProceduralFoliageSpawner`. The spawner holds an array of
`UFoliageType` entries with competition rules (spread radius, priority). Simulation runs
at cook/editor time and bakes instances into `AInstancedFoliageActor`s.

## PCG (Procedural Content Generation)

PCG is a shipped plugin at `Engine/Plugins/PCG/`. Enable it in `.uproject` if not present.

### Core types

| Type | Header | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `UPCGComponent` | `PCGComponent.h`:112 | Runs a graph on its actor; entry point for generate/cleanup |
| `UPCGGraph` | `PCGGraph.h`:332 | Asset containing nodes and edges |
| `UPCGGraphInterface` | `PCGGraph.h`:159 | Abstract base for graphs and graph instances |
| `UPCGData` | `PCGData.h` | Base for all spatial/attribute data flowing through the graph |
| `UPCGPointData` | `Data/PCGPointData.h` | Point cloud — the primary per-instance data type |
| `UPCGLandscapeData` | `Data/PCGLandscapeData.h` | Samples landscape height/normals/layers |

### `UPCGComponent` lifecycle

```
Generate()      — schedules an async graph execution, result baked as managed resources
Cleanup()       — removes all managed resources (ISM components, spawned actors)
GenerateLocal() — local-only generate (not replicated); use in editor automation
CleanupLocal()  — local-only cleanup
NotifyPropertiesChangedFromBlueprint() — dirty + re-generate from Blueprint
```

`GenerationTrigger` (`EPCGComponentGenerationTrigger`: `GenerateOnLoad`, `GenerateOnDemand`,
`GenerateAtRuntime`) controls when the graph runs automatically. Set `bIsComponentPartitioned`
to distribute generation across World Partition cells via `UPCGSubsystem`.

### Working with PCG from C++

To extend PCG, subclass `UPCGSettings` (defines node inputs/outputs/properties) and pair it
with a `UPCGElement` subclass (`Execute(FPCGContext*)`). For runtime queries:

```cpp
// Triggering PCG generation from gameplay code:
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
TObjectPtr<UPCGComponent> PCGComp;

void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    if (PCGComp)
    {
        // Force a fresh generation regardless of trigger type:
        PCGComp->Generate(/*bForce=*/true);
    }
}

// Listening to generation completion:
PCGComp->OnPCGGraphGeneratedExternal.AddDynamic(this, &AMyActor::OnPCGDone);
```

PCG landscape data (`UPCGLandscapeData`) exposes layer weights as point attributes when
`bGetLayerWeights = true` (`PCGLandscapeData.h`). Filter points by attribute value in the
graph to, for example, restrict scatter to slope ranges below a threshold.

## Performance

- **Draw calls:** foliage HISM merges thousands of instances into one draw call per cluster.
  Actor foliage (`UFoliageType_Actor`) costs one draw call per instance — avoid at scale.
- **Cull distance:** set `CullDistance` (start + end) on each `UFoliageType`; far instances
  fade with `PerInstanceFadeAmount` in the material.
- **HISM tree rebuild:** batching `AddInstances` is far cheaper than repeated `AddInstance`;
  prefer a single batch call then one `BuildTreeIfOutdated`.
- **Nanite foliage/rocks:** Nanite eliminates LOD transitions on dense geometry; enable it on
  high-poly rocks and detailed meshes (see `nanite-and-rendering`).
- **PCG generate cost:** graph execution is async but can still spike on large volumes;
  trigger on load / pre-bake where possible; prefer `GenerateOnLoad` over `GenerateAtRuntime`
  for static content.
- **Landscape component count:** aim for ≤ 1024 components; each has a render-thread CPU
  cost. Prefer fewer, larger components over many small ones.
- **World Partition streaming:** landscape proxies stream by region; foliage uses a separate
  256 m grid (configurable in Project Settings → Instanced Foliage Grid Size).

## Gotchas

- **Invalid heightmap dimensions** — landscape widths/heights must follow
  `(N × ComponentQuads) + 1`; arbitrary resolutions will be rejected or silently resized.
  Use the recommended size table (Landscape Technical Guide).
- **Missing layer info objects** — painting a weight layer requires a `ULandscapeLayerInfoObject`
  asset assigned to the layer in the landscape material; without it the layer appears in the
  UI but cannot be painted.
- **Actor foliage at density** — `UFoliageType_Actor` instances spawn one actor per instance,
  not an HISM; high density is a performance cliff. Use `UFoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh`
  unless you need per-instance Blueprint logic.
- **HISM tree stale after edit** — `AddInstance` marks the tree dirty; until the async
  rebuild completes, the BVH is inconsistent; call `BuildTreeIfOutdated(false, true)` after
  bulk edits if you need it immediately.
- **Collision on all foliage** — enabling complex collision on dense grass/foliage is
  extremely expensive; disable collision or use simple sphere/capsule only for interactive
  foliage.
- **PCG generate at runtime carelessly** — calling `Generate()` mid-frame on a large volume
  can hitch; use the async path (`GenerateLocal`) and observe the delegate for completion.
- **Foliage in World Partition** — foliage instances live in `AInstancedFoliageActor`s that
  load per cell; painting across cell boundaries splits instances. Keep foliage within cells
  or use PCG for cross-cell content.
- **Nanite landscape + LOD materials** — per-LOD material overrides (`PerLODOverrideMaterials`
  on `ALandscapeProxy`) do not apply to the Nanite mesh; use a single material that works
  at all distances.

## Version notes

- `UFoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh.NaniteOverrideMaterials` was added in UE5 for Nanite
  foliage support.
- `CleanupLocal(bool bRemoveComponents, bool bSave)` was deprecated in 5.6; use the
  `bRemoveComponents`-only overload (`PCGComponent.h`:232).
- `UPCGComponent.GenerationTrigger = GenerateAtRuntime` enables the runtime generation
  scheduler (new in 5.3+; scheduler policy expanded in 5.6/5.7).
- Landscape Edit Layers are stable since UE5; the underlying renderer classes
  (`ULandscapeEditLayerBase`) are Engine/Editor-only and should not be referenced from
  runtime game code.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
