# Finding APIs in the engine source

Deep-dive companion to [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Grounded in UE 5.8 at
`E:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.8\Engine\Source` (Build.version: 5.8.1).

A repeatable, step-by-step playbook for locating any class, function, or type
without guessing. Uses tools available to an agent (Grep, Glob, Read).

---

## Workflow 1 — You know the class name

**Goal:** find `FGameplayTag`'s header, module, and real signature.

1. **Glob for the header** — most UE types have a header named after them:
   ```
   Glob("**/*.h", path="E:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.8/Engine/Source")
   → filter for "GameplayTagContainer.h"
   ```
   Result: `Runtime\GameplayTags\Classes\GameplayTagContainer.h`.

2. **Grep for the declaration** (faster on large headers than reading the full file):
   ```
   Grep("struct FGameplayTag\b", path="...GameplayTagContainer.h", output_mode="content")
   → line 41: struct FGameplayTag
   ```

3. **Identify the module** — the file lives under `Runtime\GameplayTags\`, so the
   module name is `GameplayTags`. Confirm: `Runtime\GameplayTags\GameplayTags.Build.cs`.

4. **Determine the `#include`** — the header is under `Classes\` (a public root), so:
   ```cpp
   #include "GameplayTagContainer.h"
   ```

5. **Add to Build.cs**:
   ```
   PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "GameplayTags" });
   ```

## Workflow 2 — You know a function name, not the file

**Goal:** find `SpawnActor` signature on `UWorld`.

1. **Grep for the symbol** — limit to one pass of headers:
   ```
   Grep("SpawnActor", path="E:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.8/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Classes/Engine/World.h",
        output_mode="content")
   ```
   Scan the output for the templated overload signature.

2. **Read a focused range** around the match using Read with `offset`/`limit`. Do
   not read the full `World.h` (it exceeds 5,000 lines).

3. Note line numbers as approximate — they drift across patch releases. Cite the
   path + approximate line; reconfirm if the number matters.

---

## Workflow 3 — You know a specifier but not where it is used

**Goal:** find all uses of `ReplicatedUsing` in `Actor.h`.

```
Grep("ReplicatedUsing", path="...GameFramework/Actor.h", output_mode="content")
→ line 351, …  (UPROPERTY lines with ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_*)
```

Read a 5–10 line window around each hit to see the full UPROPERTY + member
declaration. Pattern: the UPROPERTY line immediately precedes the C++ member
declaration.

---

## Workflow 4 — You need the module for an `*_API` symbol

The export macro directly encodes the module name. Rules:

| Macro | Module |
|---|---|
| `ENGINE_API` | `Engine` |
| `CORE_API` | `Core` |
| `COREUOBJECT_API` | `CoreUObject` |
| `GAMEPLAYABILITIES_API` | `GameplayAbilities` |
| `GAMEPLAYTAGS_API` | `GameplayTags` |
| `AIMODULE_API` | `AIModule` |
| `UMG_API` | `UMG` |
| `SLATECORE_API` | `SlateCore` |

Pattern: `<MODULENAME_ALLCAPS>_API`. Strip `_API`, lowercase the result — that is
the `Build.cs` module name. Confirm by locating `<ModuleName>.Build.cs` under
the corresponding source folder.

---

## Workflow 5 — You need a plugin API

Plugin APIs live under `Engine\Plugins\` and follow the same pattern. Example:
`GAMEPLAYABILITIES_API UAbilitySystemComponent` is declared in
`Engine\Plugins\Runtime\GameplayAbilities\Source\GameplayAbilities\Public\AbilitySystemComponent.h`.

Steps:
1. Glob for the header under `Engine\Plugins\`.
2. Confirm the module via `<Module>.Build.cs` in the plugin's `Source\<Module>\`.
3. Confirm the plugin is enabled in the `.uproject`'s `Plugins` array.
4. Add the module name to `Build.cs` dependencies.

---

## Workflow 6 — Comparing a signature across engine versions

Use the other available engine roots:

| Version | Root |
|---|---|
| 5.5.1 | `E:\Repo\Git\UE_5_5_1_Fresh\UnrealEngine\Engine\Source` |
| 5.7 | `E:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7\Engine\Source` |
| 5.8.1 (primary) | `E:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.8\Engine\Source` |

Grep the same symbol in all three, then diff the results. When an API changed
between versions, document the version it changed in the skill or code you produce.

## Reading headers efficiently

| Situation | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Looking for a class | Grep `"class AMyClass\b"` in the expected file |
| Looking for a method | Grep `"MethodName"` in the header, then Read ±10 lines |
| Looking for a UPROPERTY | Grep `"MemberName"` — the UPROPERTY line is usually 1–2 lines above |
| Looking for specifiers on a known member | Read a 15-line window starting 2 lines before the member |
| Navigating a 2,000+ line header | Grep first; never read the whole file |

### Reading trick: line-range Read

When the Grep shows a hit at line 351 in `Actor.h`, read 10 lines of context:
```
Read(file_path="...Actor.h", offset=347, limit=20)
```
This avoids loading the entire file. For `Actor.h` (~4,500 lines) this is
critical.

## Reflection anatomy of a UE C++ declaration

Every UCLASS/USTRUCT/UFUNCTION/UPROPERTY header follows this pattern:

```
[Header includes CoreMinimal.h, own *.generated.h last]

UCLASS(BlueprintType, Blueprintable, config=Engine, MinimalAPI)
class MYMODULE_API AMyActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="MyGame")
    void MyFunction();

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Replicated, Category="MyGame")
    float MyValue;
};
```

Key reading points:
- `UCLASS(...)` line — tells you whether it's `BlueprintType`, `Abstract`,
  `MinimalAPI`, `config=...`, etc.
- `MYMODULE_API` — tells you the module (see Workflow 4).
- `GENERATED_BODY()` — must be first in the class body; do not remove or move it.
- `UFUNCTION(...)` on the line immediately before a function — specifiers apply
  only to that one declaration.
- `UPROPERTY(...)` on the line immediately before a member — same rule.
- The `*.generated.h` include at the bottom of the includes block is UHT output;
  never edit it.
- `meta=(...)` clauses inside specifiers carry editor / Blueprint behavior;
  replicate them faithfully when you implement similar APIs.

## Common mistakes

- **Grepping the Private folder first** — most public APIs are in `Public/` or
  `Classes/`; start there.
- **Reading the full header** — always Grep first, then read a focused range.
- **Trusting a memorized line number** — line numbers drift across patch releases.
  Grep fresh each session for precision.
- **Forgetting the `*.generated.h` include** — UHT generates it; if your header
  uses reflection macros and omits the `#include "MyClass.generated.h"` (last
  include), compilation fails with an obscure macro-not-found error.
- **Using an Editor header in Runtime code** — if the found header is under
  `Source\Editor\`, it is only available when `WITH_EDITOR` is defined. Wrapping
  it in `#if WITH_EDITOR` or moving your code to an Editor module is required.
