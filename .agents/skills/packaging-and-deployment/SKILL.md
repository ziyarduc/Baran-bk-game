# Packaging & deployment

Shipping an Unreal project involves three distinct stages that run in sequence:
**build** (compile the game executable), **cook** (convert assets to the target
platform's runtime format), and **package** (assemble the cooked assets and executable
into a distributable build, typically inside pak/IoStore containers). Each stage can fail
independently; diagnosing a failure means identifying which stage it belongs to.

## When to use this skill

- Producing a runnable build for a platform (automated CI or manual).
- Diagnosing a cook or package failure, or a build that works in PIE but breaks packaged.
- Configuring what content ships: always-cook directories, never-cook exclusions, shader sharing.
- Setting up pak chunking for streaming installs, patching, or DLC.
- Choosing the right build configuration and target for a given deployment scenario.

## Build configurations and targets

**Target types** — defined by `*.Target.cs` files, one per target:

| Target | Produces | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `Game` | Cooked, monolithic game executable | Shipping, QA, end-user builds |
| `Editor` | Modular editor + DLL set | Development only; never packaged for end users |
| `Client` | Game executable, no server code | Client-only in a client/server split |
| `Server` | Headless game server, no client rendering | Dedicated server for multiplayer |
| `Program` | Standalone program (e.g. ShaderCompileWorker) | Engine tooling |

Source: `TargetType` enum — `Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/Rules/TargetRules.cs`:21.

**Build configurations** — controls optimization and what debugging/logging facilities are
compiled in:

| Configuration | Optimized? | `check`/`ensure`? | Logging? | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Debug` | No | Yes | Full | Full engine+game debug (slow) |
| `DebugGame` | Engine yes, game no | Yes | Full | Debug game modules only |
| `Development` | Yes | Yes | Full | Daily iteration; editor default |
| `Test` | Yes | Some | Some | Performance test; shipping-like |
| `Shipping` | Max | No | Minimal | Release builds |

Source: `UnrealTargetConfiguration` enum —
`Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/UEBuildTarget.cs`:1147.

The packaging UI (`EProjectPackagingBuildConfigurations`) mirrors these five values as
`PPBC_Debug … PPBC_Shipping` — see `ProjectPackagingSettings.h`:18.

**Key rule:** always test the Shipping (or Test) configuration before release. `check()`
macros, most `UE_LOG` calls, and the console are stripped or limited in Shipping — never
put logic inside a `check` or rely on console state in packaged builds. See
`logging-and-assertions`.

## The cook process

Cooking converts editor assets (`.uasset`, textures, audio) into the target platform's
runtime format. The cooker is invoked as a special commandlet mode of `UnrealEditor-cmd`.

**What gets cooked:** assets reachable via hard or soft references from the startup map
and any "always cook" directories/entries. Unreferenced content is not cooked. This is
why a purely string-loaded asset (soft path with no reference) silently disappears unless
you declare it via the Asset Manager or `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook`.

**Cook modes:**
- **By-the-book (CBTB):** entire cook runs up front; produces the full set of cooked
  packages before packaging. Required for final/CI builds.
- **Cook on the fly (COTF):** a cook server on the host machine serves packages on demand
  as a connected device requests them. Faster iteration, but not suitable for final builds.

**Cook rules** (per primary asset, set via Asset Manager or `DefaultGame.ini`):
- `AlwaysCook` — include regardless of reference.
- `NeverCook` — exclude even if referenced (e.g. editor-only test assets).
- `Unknown` — follow reference graph (default).

Shader code can be shared across materials via `bShareMaterialShaderCode` in
`UProjectPackagingSettings` — reduces duplication at a small load-time cost.

## UAT BuildCookRun — the canonical pipeline

The Unreal Automation Tool (`RunUAT.bat` / `RunUAT.sh`) orchestrates the full pipeline
via its `BuildCookRun` command:

```
Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.bat BuildCookRun \
  -project=D:/MyGame/MyGame.uproject \
  -noP4 \
  -platform=Win64 \
  -clientconfig=Shipping \
  -build \
  -cook \
  -allmaps \
  -stage \
  -pak \
  -archive \
  -archivedirectory=D:/Builds/MyGame_Shipping
```

Each flag maps to a stage: `-build` compiles the target, `-cook` runs the cooker,
`-stage` copies to a staging directory, `-pak` wraps cooked content into .pak/IoStore
containers, `-archive` copies the final build to the output path. Omit any stage to skip
it (e.g. skip `-build` when the executable is already built by a separate CI step).

Add `-iostore` to enable IoStore container output (`.utoc`/`.ucas`) instead of classic
`.pak`-only output. This matches enabling `bUseIoStore` in Project Settings.

UAT script path (C#): `Engine/Source/Programs/AutomationTool/Scripts/BuildCookRun.Automation.cs`.

Full BuildCookRun flag reference: [references/buildcookrun-and-uat.md](references/buildcookrun-and-uat.md).

## Pak files and the IoStore container format

After cooking, content is packaged into containers for distribution:

- **Classic pak (`.pak`):** a simple archive format; a single monolithic file or one per
  chunk. Still fully supported; adequate for many projects.
- **IoStore (`.utoc` + `.ucas`):** the modern default. `.utoc` is the table of contents;
  `.ucas` holds the bulk payload. Offers faster I/O via the IoDispatcher because packages
  are addressed by hash ID rather than path. Enabled via `bUseIoStore = true` in Project
  Settings (or `-iostore` flag to UAT).

Both formats support compression (`bCompressed`, `PackageCompressionFormat`) and
encryption (configured via the crypto key system, not the deprecated ini flags).

**Chunking** splits content across multiple pak/IoStore containers for streaming installs,
DLC, or patching. Each chunk maps to a numbered `.pak` / `.ucas` file (e.g.
`pakchunk1-Windows.pak`). Chunk 0 is the base install; chunks 1+ are downloaded
separately. Configure via `bGenerateChunks = true` and Primary Asset Rules.

Details: [references/pak-iostore-and-chunking.md](references/pak-iostore-and-chunking.md).

## ProjectPackagingSettings — what ships

`UProjectPackagingSettings` (`UCLASS(config=Game, defaultconfig)`) persists to
`Config/DefaultGame.ini` under section `[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]`.
Key properties (verified in
`Engine/Source/Developer/DeveloperToolSettings/Classes/Settings/ProjectPackagingSettings.h`):

| Property | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BuildConfiguration` (`PPBC_*`) | Which configuration to build |
| `bUseIoStore` | Use `.utoc`/`.ucas` IoStore containers |
| `bUseZenStore` | Use Zen Server as cooked data store (requires `bUseIoStore`) |
| `bGenerateChunks` | Split content into numbered chunks |
| `bGenerateNoChunks` | Override all platforms to disable chunking |
| `bChunkHardReferencesOnly` | Only hard-reference dependencies follow their chunk |
| `bCompressed` | Compress cooked packages |
| `PackageCompressionFormat` | Comma-separated list (e.g. `Oodle`) |
| `bShareMaterialShaderCode` | Deduplicate shader bytecode across materials |
| `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook` | Force-cook these content paths regardless of references |
| `DirectoriesToNeverCook` | Exclude these paths even if referenced |
| `MapsToCook` | Explicit map list when not using `-allmaps` |
| `bCookAll` | Cook every asset in the content directory |
| `bSkipEditorContent` | Exclude `/Game/Editor*` folders from the cook |

Access in code: `GetDefault<UProjectPackagingSettings>()` (editor only).

## Platforms, Device Profiles, and scalability

Each platform target (Win64, Android, iOS, console) requires its SDK and platform files.
Platform-specific packaging overrides live in `Config/[Platform]/[Platform]Game.ini`.

**Device Profiles** (`DeviceProfiles.ini`) set per-platform CVars and scalability groups —
the correct way to vary rendering quality per platform. Never hardcode `r.*` CVars in
C++ or Blueprint; use Device Profiles so the cooker and runtime can select them correctly.

A **Client/Server** split (`Game` + `Server` targets built separately) is the standard
multiplayer packaging pattern; the server binary runs headless and ships without rendering
modules. See `networking-and-replication`.

## Content-on-demand / IoStore On-Demand

The IoStore On-Demand system (`Runtime/Experimental/IoStore/OnDemand/`) allows a shipped
game to fetch content from a CDN at runtime rather than requiring it to be installed
upfront. The `IOnDemandIoStore` interface (`IoStoreOnDemand.h`) manages requests with
statuses Pending / Ok / Cancelled / Error. This is the foundation for streaming installs,
live-service content drops, and large-world on-demand streaming beyond what the base chunk
system handles.

## Shipping vs. development (mind the gap)

| Behavior | Development | Shipping |
|---|---|---|
| `check()` / `ensure()` | Fire, assert | Compiled out (`DO_CHECK=0`) |
| `UE_LOG(...)` | All categories | Most stripped; use sparingly |
| Console commands | Available | Removed |
| `WITH_EDITOR` code | Included | Excluded |
| Editor modules | Loaded | Not present |

Always smoke-test a **packaged Shipping build** before release — PIE and Development
builds mask many of these gaps. Guard editor-only code with `#if WITH_EDITOR` so it
compiles out of runtime targets. See `logging-and-assertions` for `verify` vs `check`.

## Gotchas

- **Editor-only API in runtime code** — cook/link errors; gate with `#if WITH_EDITOR`.
- **Content not reachable** — not cooked → missing at runtime. Hard-ref or add to
  `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook`. Use the Asset Audit window to inspect chunk assignments.
- **Works in PIE, broken packaged** — typically editor-only deps, uncooked assets, or
  absolute file paths.
- **`check`/`ensure`/`UE_LOG` used for logic** — silently does nothing in Shipping;
  never put required side-effects inside them.
- **Hardcoded `r.*` CVars** — bypass Device Profiles and platform-specific scalability.
- **Forgot `-iostore` flag with IoStore settings** — UAT and Project Settings must agree.
- **bUseZenStore without bUseIoStore** — Zen Store is a no-op unless IoStore is enabled.
- **Wrong target cooked** — cooking the Editor target instead of Game produces an
  unrunnable result; confirm the `BuildTarget` in `ProjectPackagingSettings`.
- **Cook time blowup** — enable iterative cooking (`-iterate` flag to UAT) during
  iteration; disable for final CI builds to guarantee a clean output.

## Version notes

- **IoStore as modern default:** `bUseIoStore` defaults to `true` for new projects as of
  UE5. Classic `.pak`-only builds still work. Console platforms often require IoStore.
- **Zen Store** (`bUseZenStore`): introduced in UE5, off by default, used by some large
  first-party titles to centralize cooked data.
- **Blueprint nativization** is deprecated (removed in UE5, `UE_DEPRECATED(5.0, ...)`);
  do not rely on it.

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).
