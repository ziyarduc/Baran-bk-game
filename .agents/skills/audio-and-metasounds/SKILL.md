# Audio & MetaSounds

The Unreal audio pipeline: a **sound asset** (`USoundBase` subclass) is activated either
as a fire-and-forget one-shot or via a **`UAudioComponent`** for ongoing control. 3D
sounds are positioned and faded using a **`USoundAttenuation`** asset. Mixing is handled
through **sound classes**, **submixes**, and **concurrency** objects. MetaSounds are the
modern, node-based, parameter-driven replacement for SoundCues.

## When to use this skill

- Playing SFX (gunshots, footsteps, impacts), music, or UI sounds from C++.
- Attaching a looping or positional sound to an actor (engine hum, ambience).
- 3D spatialization and distance falloff configuration.
- Mixing: volume groups, ducking music under dialogue, limiting voice counts.
- Procedural/parameterized audio (footsteps that vary, adaptive music) via MetaSounds.
- Beat-synchronized audio events with the Quartz clock system.
- Building or modifying MetaSound graphs at runtime via the Builder API.

## Sound asset types

| Asset | Class | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Imported PCM clip | `USoundWave` | Raw audio; compose variation in a cue or MetaSound |
| Legacy node graph | `USoundCue` | Simple randomization / modulation over waves |
| Modern graph with typed I/O | `UMetaSoundSource` | Procedural, parameter-driven, DSP-composable audio |
| Abstract base | `USoundBase` | The type accepted by all play functions |

Prefer **MetaSounds** for new dynamic audio. SoundCues remain fully supported and are
simpler for lightweight randomization. `USoundWave` is never played directly in gameplay
code — it is the leaf asset referenced inside cues or MetaSound graphs.

## Playing sounds from C++

```cpp
#include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
#include "Components/AudioComponent.h"

// 2D (UI, music) — fire-and-forget, no spatialization:
UGameplayStatics::PlaySound2D(this, UISound);

// 3D at a world position — fire-and-forget:
UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(this, ExplosionSound, HitLocation,
    FRotator::ZeroRotator, 1.f, 1.f, 0.f, AttenuationAsset);

// 3D attached to a component — returns controllable UAudioComponent:
UAudioComponent* AC = UGameplayStatics::SpawnSoundAttached(
    EngineLoop, VehicleMesh, NAME_None);
AC->FadeIn(0.5f);

// Stop or adjust later:
AC->SetFloatParameter(TEXT("RPM"), 4200.f);  // MetaSound input
AC->FadeOut(0.3f, 0.f);
```

`PlaySound*` functions are fire-and-forget. Use `SpawnSound*` or a
`UAudioComponent` placed on the actor when you need to stop, fade, change
parameters, or react to `OnAudioFinished`. Store the component in a
`UPROPERTY()`  member so GC cannot collect it while it is playing (see
`memory-and-gc`).

### Audio component placed on an actor

```cpp
// Header — owned audio component, UPROPERTY keeps it alive:
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
TObjectPtr<UAudioComponent> EngineAudio;

// Constructor:
EngineAudio = CreateDefaultSubobject<UAudioComponent>(TEXT("EngineAudio"));
EngineAudio->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
EngineAudio->bAutoActivate = false;   // start silent; Play() from BeginPlay

// BeginPlay:
EngineAudio->SetSound(EngineLoopAsset);
EngineAudio->Play();
```

See [references/audiocomponent-and-playback.md](references/audiocomponent-and-playback.md)
for the full `UAudioComponent` API, delegates, and playback state machine.

## 3D spatialization & attenuation

A `USoundAttenuation` asset bundles: distance model and falloff radius,
spatialization algorithm (panning or HRTF plugin), occlusion, reverb send,
air absorption, and priority attenuation. Assign it on the sound asset itself
(`AttenuationSettings` on `USoundBase`) or override it per-call by passing it
to `PlaySoundAtLocation` / `SpawnSoundAttached`.

A sound without an attenuation asset plays as flat 2D regardless of where the
audio component is in the world. The inner radius defines a constant-volume
zone; falloff begins at the inner radius and reaches zero at the falloff
distance.

See [references/attenuation-and-spatialization.md](references/attenuation-and-spatialization.md)
for the full `FSoundAttenuationSettings` fields, distance models, HRTF, and
Audio Gameplay Volumes.

## Mixing: classes, submixes, concurrency

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Sound Class** (`USoundClass`) | Group sounds (SFX / Music / Voice) for shared volume, pitch, and property settings |
| **Sound Mix** (`USoundMix`) | Push temporary class adjustments — duck Music when a Voice plays |
| **Submix** (`USoundSubmix`) | DSP bus: apply effects (reverb, EQ, compression), meter, record audio |
| **Concurrency** (`USoundConcurrency`) | Cap simultaneous voices in a group; choose a steal rule when limit is hit |

A sound routes to its sound class's submix by default. Submix sends let a
sound copy signal to additional buses (e.g. a reverb or analysis bus) without
leaving the main chain. Audio Buses (`UAudioBus`) are an alternative bus type
that route before or after source effects, useful for sidechaining.

See [references/mixing-classes-submixes-concurrency.md](references/mixing-classes-submixes-concurrency.md)
for concurrency steal rules, submix effect chains, audio bus sends, and
dynamic mixing from C++.

## MetaSound parameters at runtime

MetaSound Sources expose **typed inputs** (float, int32, bool, trigger, wave)
declared in the graph. Drive them from the owning audio component:

```cpp
// Set before or during playback:
AC->SetFloatParameter(TEXT("Intensity"),   0.8f);
AC->SetBoolParameter(TEXT("IsUnderwater"), true);
AC->SetIntParameter(TEXT("FootSurface"),   2);

// Trigger a one-shot event inside the graph (stateless pulse):
AC->SetTriggerParameter(TEXT("OnImpact"));

// Swap the wave asset a graph node is playing:
AC->SetWaveParameter(TEXT("ImpactWave"), GroundHitWave);
```

Input names are **case-sensitive `FName`** values that must exactly match the
graph's Input node names. A mismatch produces no error and no effect. The
parameter interface is declared in
`Runtime/Engine/Public/Audio/SoundParameterControllerInterface.h`.

MetaSounds also expose **outputs** (e.g., a float metering value). Read them
through `UMetasoundGeneratorHandle` obtained from `UMetaSoundSource::
GetGeneratorForAudioComponent` — available only while the sound is playing.

See [references/metasound-parameters-and-builder.md](references/metasound-parameters-and-builder.md)
for the Builder API, output watching, and runtime graph authoring.

## Quartz: beat-quantized playback

Quartz provides a **game-thread musical clock** (`UQuartzClockHandle`) that
fires events on beat/bar boundaries. Use it to start sounds precisely on the
beat without drifting audio timers:

```cpp
// Obtain the clock subsystem and create or find a named clock:
UQuartzSubsystem* Quartz = UQuartzSubsystem::Get(GetWorld());
UQuartzClockHandle* Clock = Quartz->CreateNewClock(this, TEXT("MusicClock"),
    FQuartzClockSettings{});

// Schedule a sound to start on the next bar boundary:
FQuartzQuantizationBoundary Boundary;
Boundary.Quantization = EQuartzCommandQuantization::Bar;
Boundary.BoundaryType = EQuarztQuantizationBoundaryType::FromNow;
AC->PlayQuantized(GetWorld(), Clock, Boundary, {});
```

The Quartz subsystem (`UQuartzSubsystem`) lives in the Audio Mixer module.
`UAudioComponent::PlayQuantized` is declared in `AudioComponent.h`:521.

## Triggering from gameplay & animation

Footstep, impact, and weapon sounds should be triggered from **Anim Notifies**
(see `animation-system`) or gameplay events, not manual timers. This keeps
audio in sync at any play rate or time dilation. For high-frequency impacts use
concurrency to avoid voice spam — limit simultaneous instances and choose an
appropriate steal rule.

## Gotchas

- **Fire-and-forget when you needed control** — `PlaySound*` returns nothing;
  use `SpawnSound*` or a component to stop, fade, or change parameters later.
- **No attenuation asset** → 3D sound plays as 2D, no falloff.
- **Parameter name mismatch** on MetaSounds → silent no-op, no log warning.
- **No concurrency limits** → voice spam and clipping under heavy action.
- **Audio component not in a `UPROPERTY`** → GC'd while playing, sound stops.
- **`SetWaveParameter` called on a SoundCue** → no effect; wave params target
  MetaSound wave inputs (or legacy SoundCue wave params — different systems).
- **`bDisableParameterUpdatesWhilePlaying`** set on the component → parameter
  calls are queued but not forwarded to the active sound.
- **Importing non-WAV** → import PCM WAV only; build variation inside
  MetaSound or SoundCue graphs rather than baking it into the file.
- **Virtualization** — `EVirtualizationMode` on `USoundBase` controls whether
  looping sounds silently continue (`PlayWhenSilent`), restart, or drop when
  evicted. Default is `Disabled`; forgotten virtualization config is a common
  cause of music "disappearing" under heavy load.

## Version notes

- MetaSounds were introduced in UE5.0; the Builder API (Beta) expanded
  significantly in 5.4–5.5; output watching via `UMetasoundGeneratorHandle`
  was stabilised in 5.4.
- `EVirtualizationMode::SeekRestart` is experimental as of UE 5.6–5.8
  (`SoundBase.h`:76).
- `FAudioComponentParam` (old named-parameter struct) was deprecated in UE 5.0;
  use `FAudioParameter` / `SetFloatParameter` etc. instead.
- `OnGeneratorInstanceCreated` / `OnGeneratorInstanceDestroyed` on
  `UMetaSoundSource` deprecated in 5.6; use `OnGeneratorInstanceInfoCreated`
  / `OnGeneratorInstanceInfoDestroyed` (`MetasoundSource.h`:338–344).

## Bakırköy BR Core Constraints & MVP Directives

When applying this skill to the **Bakırköy BR** project, you MUST strictly adhere to:

### 1. The 7 Core Constraints
1. **No Interior Spaces**: Buildings are exterior-only collision volumes. No interior rooms, furniture, or interior NavMesh. Rooftop/terrace access is strictly via external stairs, ladders, or fire escapes.
2. **Solo BR Only**: First prototype supports Solo mode only. No squad logic, duos, revives, DBNO (Down-But-Not-Out), or team chat.
3. **Server-Authoritative**: Dedicated server validates and executes all gameplay state changes (HP, Shield, ammo, damage, storm, eliminations). Client predicts locally, server reconciles.
4. **3rd Person Camera**: Over-the-shoulder perspective only. ADS tightens camera FOV and spring arm length, but NEVER switches to 1st person.
5. **3 Build Materials**: Exactly 3 materials: Moloz (Debris: 60 start / 100 max HP), Tuğla (Brick: 80 start / 200 max HP), and Çelik (Steel: 100 start / 350 max HP). Never 4 materials.
6. **Hybrid Hit Detection**: AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper use server Hit-Scan line traces (`LineTraceSingleByChannel`). Rocket Launcher uses Chaos Projectile physics (`ABRProjectile` actor with 35 m/s velocity and radial splash damage).
7. **Mandatory C++ `BR` Prefix**: Every gameplay class, struct, and enum MUST be prefixed with `BR` (e.g. `ABRCharacter`, `UBRHealthComponent`, `FBRWeaponData`, `EBRBuildMaterial`).

### 2. Demo 1 Playable MVP Directives
- **10 Bots Test Scenario**: AI count is strictly limited to 10 bots. GameMode and AI logic must be optimized for this 10-bot vertical slice.
- **2 Weapon Prototypes**: Initial loot pool and combat mechanics test the hybrid hit detection using exactly 2 weapons: 1 Assault Rifle (Hit-Scan) and 1 Rocket Launcher (Projectile physics + splash damage).
- **Dual GameModes**: Support 2 distinct playable GameModes: Mode 1 Free-For-All (FFA / Deathmatch with score/time limit) and Mode 2 Classic Battle Royale (Last Man Standing with shrinking storm circle).
- **Building System Paused**: Building system is paused for Demo 1. Players and bots rely entirely on natural environment cover (vehicles, alleys, street walls).

### Domain Adaptation: Audio & MetaSounds
- **Exterior Acoustic Model**: MetaSounds patches should simulate outdoor urban acoustics (narrow street reverb, alley reflections, open rooftop spatialization).
- **Prototype Weapon Audio**: Audio synthesis for AR firing/reloading and Rocket Launcher launch/explosion.
- **Storm Warning**: Audio siren and atmospheric bass hum for the shrinking storm boundary.
